The key-points/assets mentioned are likely to be my fuzzy work, if they aren't the source is mentioned or it could be
highly likely that I've forgotten ðŸ˜¨ if that's the case feel free to create an issue and I'll add the source or remove
the content(images) or add a owner/source/copywright note as applicable.

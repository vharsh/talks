* Personal Opinions on good posture
- Good posture & comfort, choose both

- ^ verify all of it from experts

* Basic machine/desk ergonomics
- Blog from Zapier:
.link https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-desk/
- Blink your ðŸ‘€!
- My take: Raise your laptop high enough and use an external keyboard

* Delegate less important things to your muscle memory
- Try to touch-type as much as possible, mind the raised edges on [f] & [j] keys

- Keyboard & mouse, prefer the former
- vim or emacs or vscode, choose the one which keeps you productive/happy
- Put this in your ~/.${SHELL}rc , EDITOR=$(which <your-fav-choice>)


* Why NOT choose a bare-bones editor like vi
- prefer to use [Shift] + <Click> to select text and feel it's more productive
- you know your favourite IDE's key bindings well enough and find ðŸ–± convenient
- For writing K8s YAMLs I use VS-Code(hands down)

* Why choose vi/vim/nvim/emacs over fancy GUIs
- _This presentation has been written using nvim_
- using Jetbrains IDEs/vscode will be hard if your files are in a different machine
- vi is everywhere
- You can check-in your editorconfig to GitHub

* We got some moves
- Ditch the menus, cryptic key commands which aren't on the home row
- Move around with hjkl, left, up, down, right
- Move around with steroids
- Editing texts with steroids
- You can always get the best of the both worlds in your IDEs till you haven't mastered vim keybindings

* Vi, We Eye
Real programmers use Vi/Vim/Emacs/VsCode/Jetbrains-xyz/nano/etc
Vim isn't the superior or the inferior text-editor, it's just that there was no ðŸ–± or arrow keys back then


* What Vi
- Modal editing, `command`, `insert`, `visual` for executing commands, inserting text, selecting texts
- !rich-text like OpenOffice
- steep initial learning curve ðŸ§—


* Vim through(most popular vi clone)
- frustrating editor (5-10 minutes)
- emergency editor in the short run(1-2 weeks)
- very rewarding in the long run(~10-15years)

* Moving fast in vim
- Moving one screen, half a screen
- Moving your cursor to the edges of the screens
- Moving with 

* What do you need to do in Vim
- Update text(Join, Append, Insert at end, Insert at beginning, insert, replace, Substitute)
- Write new text(insert)
- Delete text(delete, cut)
- Undo(uU)/Redo(^R)
- Opening a line
- Got to change names' cases?
